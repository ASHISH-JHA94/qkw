# QKW 
## Generalizing aliasing to simplify navigation, and executing complex multi-line terminal command sequencesÂ¶

The purpose of this application is to tag anything with a _label_ and, use it to retrieve the associated data for other applications. Some of qkw's use cases:

* Quickly test a set of commands with different options in different environments. 
* Rapidly create variations, and save them with a versioned tag. 
* Add a _help-string_ or _note_ with the associated data.
* Similar functionality, but different command base/ options can be tagged with identical tags and executed.
* Store the data in a file rather than a executable script, and also search for the content. 
* Save/retrieve the script formatted as a string, as it is to/from a file. 
* Use this as a _clipboard_ to store the stdout/stderr for inspection or analysis. 
* Easily share the functional blocks of your _application like initialization, settings, etc_ by just sharing the database, where user is abstracted away from the details and focuses on using the functionality by mere execution of the tags.


For example:

> In different environments, say in linux flavors, one might be _**repeating identical functionality with the same tag in different environments**_. One of the first things a user would like to do in linux is to have their _bashrc_ configured with their personal set of commands. Using this tool it becomes easy, by saving under two C-tables, say one for _ubuntu_, and one for _opensuse_. It's enough if the end user just retrieves and executes(sources) the tag bashrc.

The basic tables used to store the data

*  _cmd_ :commands,scripts,etc with a note
*  _dir_ :directory paths

[**Manual**](https://github.com/ravijanjam/qkw/blob/master/docs/qkw-manual.pdf) contains information about use cases, and all the available options.

[**Quick Start**](https://github.com/ravijanjam/qkw/wiki/Workflows)

**Installation (Ubuntu/Debian)**

```bash

apt-get update
apt-get install -y git gcc g++ pkg-config cmake make
apt-get install -y libsqlite3-dev
```

* To keep building simple, a python script is set up which checks for requirements _(fmt,sqlite3,yaml)_, and a sanity check for required headers. Any errors will be in writen to the log file
```bash
python3 checktools.py
```
* If necessary, modify the compile options `OPTS_SQLITE_3,OPTS_YAML-CPP,OPTS_FMT` in the Makefile, to point to the libs, and headers. There are subtle differences in libraries installed via _lib_ as a dev package or via compiled libraries. `pkg-config` provided options can work as well. 

* Get into the `build` directory, and follow instructions for installing the dependencies [[fmt]](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt), and [[yaml-cpp]](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp)

* Running `checktools.py` should download the github repos for `fmt`, and `yaml` into [[build]](github.com/ravijanjam/qkw/build) directory. Check the _log files_ in the same directory as the script executes or breaks


```bash
make build
make install
make clean
```

Setup the environment variable
```bash
export QKW_CONFIG=/etc/qkw-data/qkw-config.yaml
```

Start the program and check the default tables `userdata.db` has two tables dir\_1, and cmd\_1

```bash

# get version info
qkw -v

# list all tables
qkw -T -lA 

# man pages
man qkw
```
